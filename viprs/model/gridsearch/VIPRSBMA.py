    """
    The `VIPRSBMA` class is an extension of the `VIPRSGrid` class that
    implements Bayesian model averaging for the `VIPRS` models in the grid.
    Bayesian model averaging is a technique that allows us to combine the
    results of multiple models by weighting them according to their evidence.
    In this context, we weigh the model by their final ELBO values.

    For more details on the BMA procedure implemented here, refer to the
